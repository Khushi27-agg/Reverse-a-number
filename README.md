# Reverse-a-number using Java
This project demonstrates how to reverse a number in Java by taking user input at runtime. The program reads an integer from the user using the Scanner class and reverses it using basic arithmetic operations such as modulo (%) and division (/).

# Features

Accepts integer input from the user

Reverses the given number using an iterative approach

Uses Scanner for input handling

Simple and efficient logic

Clean console output

# Key Concepts Used

Scanner class for user input

while loop

Modulo (%) and division (/) operators

Variable manipulation

Console input/output

# Technologies Used

Language: Java

Library: java.util.Scanner

▶ How to Run

Save the file as Main.java

Compile the program:

javac Main.java


Run the program:

java Main


Enter a number when prompted.

# Sample Output
Enter a number: 4567
Reversed number is: 7654

# Learning Outcome

This project helped in understanding how to take user input in Java, apply loop-based logic, and manipulate numbers efficiently. It also reinforces the importance of updating variables correctly inside loops to avoid logical errors.
